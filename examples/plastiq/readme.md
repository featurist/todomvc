# Plastiq TodoMVC Example

> Plastiq is a tiny framework for single page apps based on [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom).


## Learning Plastiq

[Plastiq on Github](https://github.com/featurist/plastiq) is the best place to
start.


## Implementation

The implementation is just one [Pogoscript](http://pogoscript.org) file,
[app.pogo](app.pogo).


## Running

Compile app.pogo as js/app.js:
```
npm run build
```

Keep doing that any time app.pogo changes:
```
npm run watch
```
